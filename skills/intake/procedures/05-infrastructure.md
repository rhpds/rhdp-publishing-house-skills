# Infrastructure Confirmation

Phase 5 of the intake flow. Capture infrastructure requirements as a single confirm-or-adjust interaction.

## Determine Platform

Read `publishing-house/spec.yaml` inline comments to understand valid values.
Determine the platform from the products discussed in discovery:

| Signal | Platform |
|--------|----------|
| Products include OpenShift, OCP, OCP Virt, RHOAI, or any OCP operator | `platform: ocp` |
| Products are AAP, RHEL, Satellite, or other non-OCP products | `platform: rhel-vms` |
| Mixed (e.g., AAP + OpenShift) | `platform: ocp` (OCP is the infrastructure base) |

## Derive Defaults

Based on platform and products:

### For `platform: ocp`

| Signal | Default |
|--------|---------|
| Products include OCP Virtualization/CNV | `cluster_type: multinode` |
| Simple OCP lab | `cluster_type: sno` if single-user, `multinode` otherwise |
| OCP version not specified | `ocp_version: "4.20"` (minimum) |

### For `platform: rhel-vms`

Propose per-student VM roles based on the products. For example:
- AAP lab → 1 AAP controller (8 vCPU, 32GB), 2 RHEL managed nodes (2 vCPU, 8GB each)
- AAP + Windows → add 1 Windows Server node (4 vCPU, 8GB)
- AAP + EDA → add EDA controller resources or increase AAP controller sizing

Do NOT propose OCP fields (ocp_version, cluster_type, control_plane_*, worker_*) for
RHEL-based labs. Those fields are irrelevant.

### Common defaults (both platforms)

| Signal | Default |
|--------|---------|
| Products include AI keywords | `ai_requirement: maas`, `ai_model_tier: open-source` |
| No AI keywords | `ai_requirement: none` |
| AI requirement is GPU | `cloud_provider: aws` (overwrites existing value) |
| No specific cloud reason | `cloud_provider: cnv` (platform default) |
| Bare-metal or nested virt requirements | `cloud_provider: troshka` |
| Azure-based deployments | `cloud_provider: azure` |
| ARO (Azure Red Hat OpenShift) | `cloud_provider: aro` |
| ROSA (Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS) | `cloud_provider: rosa` |
| No topology discussed | `topology: shared-cluster` |

## Present as One Profile

Present a complete infrastructure profile for confirmation — not individual questions.
Only include fields relevant to the detected platform.

**For OCP labs:**
> "Based on your products, here's the infrastructure profile:
>
> - **Platform:** OCP
> - **Cloud provider:** CNV
> - **Cluster type:** Multinode, 6 workers (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 100GB disk)
> - **OCP version:** 4.20
> - **Topology:** Per-student
>
> Does this look right, or should I adjust anything?"

**For RHEL-based labs:**
> "Based on your products, here's the infrastructure profile:
>
> - **Platform:** RHEL VMs (provisioned via CNV)
> - **Per student:**
>   - 1 AAP controller (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM)
>   - 2 RHEL managed nodes (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM each)
>   - 1 Windows Server (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
> - **Topology:** Per-student
> - **AAP version:** 2.5
>
> Does this look right, or should I adjust anything?"

## Conditional Follow-ups

Only ask these if triggered — do not ask them by default:

- **AI/MaaS:** Only if products include AI keywords. Default to MaaS + open-source.
  If author chooses frontier model or GPU: "Why is an open-source model insufficient?"
- **AAP version:** Only if AAP is in the products list.
- **Non-GA products:** Only if any product is labeled beta, tech preview, or early access.
  If non-empty: "How will access be provided during provisioning?"
- **Concurrent users:** Only if topology is shared-cluster. Per-student and cnv-pool
  topologies give each learner their own environment — the number of simultaneous users
  is an operational decision made at scheduling time, not during intake. Do NOT ask the
  author how many people will be in a room or at an event.
- **External services:** Ask explicitly. This covers ALL external services the lab environment
  needs to reach — both during provisioning/deployment and during the student session. Do NOT
  let the author answer "none" based only on what the student sees. Prompt them to consider:
  container registries, package repos, license servers, external APIs, Git hosts, anything
  the automation pulls from during setup. "None" is only correct if the environment is fully
  air-gapped with all content pre-staged. If the author is unsure, list the likely candidates
  based on their products and leave them to confirm.

## Confirmation Required

**After the author provides adjustments, present the updated profile and wait for
explicit confirmation before proceeding.** Do NOT silently apply changes and move on.

> "Here's the updated infrastructure profile: [show updated fields].
> Does this look good to move forward?"

Only proceed to Phase 6 after the author confirms.

## Rules

- Do NOT fabricate explanations for why a field is relevant when it isn't.
- If the author challenges a field, remove it or leave it blank. Do not invent justifications.
- Only propose fields that are directly relevant to the products and platform.
- If you're unsure whether a field applies, leave it for the infra reviewer.
- Do NOT propose OCP fields (ocp_version, cluster_type, worker_*) for RHEL-based labs.

## Write Point

Write all infrastructure fields to spec.yaml (platform-appropriate fields only) and
update the Infrastructure Requirements section of design.md:

```bash
git add publishing-house/spec.yaml publishing-house/spec/design.md
git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "feat: phase 5 — infrastructure confirmed" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Proceed to Phase 6 (finalize + submit).
