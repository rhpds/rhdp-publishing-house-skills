# Intake Questions — Canonical List

Ask these questions **exactly as written**, **in this order**, **one at a time**.
Skip any question whose `spec.yaml field` already has a value.
After each answer, immediately write to spec.yaml.

---

## Q1: Main Goal

> **What will someone be able to DO after completing this?** Be specific — a concrete, measurable outcome.

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.title` (derive a short title from the goal)
- **Also captures:** the problem statement for design.md

## Q2: Target Audience

> **Who is this for?** What's their role, experience level, and what background knowledge should they have?

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.audience` (one of: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`)

## Q3: Products and Technologies

> **Which Red Hat products and technologies are involved?** Include full product names and versions if known.

- **Used in:** design.md Products & Technologies section

### Fire RCARS Advisor Query (silent, after Q3)

Immediately after Q3 is answered, fire the RCARS advisor query in the background so
results are ready by Q24. Do NOT wait for the response — continue with Q4.

1. Read `central` from `~/.config/publishing-house/auth.json`
2. Build a natural-language query from Q1 (goal), Q2 (audience), and Q3 (products):
   `"A {audience} {content_type or 'lab'} covering {products} that teaches {goal}"`
3. Call silently:
   ```bash
   curl -sk -X POST "{central_url}/api/v1/rcars/advisor?query={url_encoded_query}" 2>&1
   ```
4. Save the `job_id` from the response for use in Q24. If the call fails, set `job_id` to null.

**Do NOT show the author anything. Do NOT wait. Proceed to Q4 immediately.**

## Q4: Content Type (if not set)

> **Is this a hands-on lab, a guided demo, or a workshop?**

- **Skip if:** `project.content_type` is already set
- **spec.yaml field:** `project.content_type` (one of: `lab`, `demo`, `workshop`)

## Q5: Showroom Type (if not set)

> **Will this be a standard Showroom lab (Classic) or an embedded Zero-Touch experience?**

- **Skip if:** `project.showroom_type` is already set
- **spec.yaml field:** `project.showroom_type` (one of: `classic`, `zero_touch`)

## Q6: Environment

> **What does the learner start with, and what needs to be pre-configured by automation?** For example: a shared OpenShift cluster with operators pre-installed, or a per-student cluster with nothing installed.

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.topology` (one of: `shared-cluster`, `per-student`, `cnv-pool`)
- **Also captures:** environment details for design.md

## Q7: Total Duration

> **How long should this take end to end?** Consider the complexity of what you described.

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.duration_hours`

## Q8: Module Structure

> **Let me propose a module breakdown based on what you've described.** [Present proposed modules with titles and estimated durations, 15-45 min each.] **Does this structure work, or would you adjust it?**

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.modules` (list of `{title, duration_min}`)

## Q9: Module Relationship

> **How do these modules relate to each other?**
> 1. **Sequential** — they build on each other and must be done in order
> 2. **Independent with shared context** — can be done in any order but share a scenario
> 3. **Fully independent** — standalone topics

- **Used in:** design.md Module Map section

## Q10: Difficulty Level

**Skip — already captured in Q2** (`spec.audience`). Do not ask again.

## Q11: OpenShift Version

> **Which OpenShift version should this target?** For example: 4.17, 4.18, 4.19.

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.ocp_version`

## Q12: Infrastructure Requirements

> **Let me confirm the infrastructure needs.** Based on what you described:
> - **Base infrastructure:** [propose: ocp4-cluster, ocp-workloads, or cloud-vms-base]
> - **Sizing:** [propose worker count and resources — e.g. 6 workers, 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 100GB disk]
> - **Cloud provider:** CNV (default) or AWS?
> - **Automation approach:** Ansible, GitOps (Helm + ArgoCD), or combo?
>
> **Does this sound right, or should I adjust anything?**

**After the user confirms**, if `worker_count` is 0, ask this follow-up:

> **With zero worker nodes, is this a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) deployment?** SNO runs everything on one control-plane node. If you need separate workers later, we can switch to multinode.

- If yes (or user confirmed 0 workers without objecting): set `cluster_type: sno`
- If no (user says they want workers): ask for the worker count and set `cluster_type: multinode`
- If `worker_count` > 0: set `cluster_type: multinode` automatically (no follow-up needed)

- **spec.yaml fields:** `spec.environment.cloud_provider` (cnv | aws), `spec.environment.cluster_type` (sno | multinode), `worker_count`, `worker_cpu`, `worker_ram_gb`, `worker_disk_gb`
- **Used in:** design.md Infrastructure Requirements section

## Q13: Reference Material

> **Do you have any reference material I should work from?** Internal docs, existing labs, recorded demos, architecture diagrams, or blog posts?

- **Used in:** informs design.md content

---

## Infrastructure & Compliance Questions

*Ask Q14–Q18 after Q13. Skip any whose spec.yaml field already has a value.*

## Q14: Concurrent Users

**Ask when:** `topology = per-student` or `topology = cnv-pool`

> **How many students will use this simultaneously at peak?**
> For example: 25 students in a live workshop, or 5 at a time in self-paced access.

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.max_concurrent_users`
- **Validation:** Required if topology is per-student or cnv-pool. Block if blank.

## Q15: AI / MaaS Requirement

**Ask when:** Any product includes AI/LLM keywords (OpenShift AI, RHOAI, MaaS, Granite, InstructLab, Ollama, LLM, model serving, inference)

> **Does this lab use AI or large language models at runtime?**
>
> - **MaaS** (recommended) — our shared model service. No GPU needed, pre-approved for all labs.
> - **Dedicated GPU** — expensive and scarce. Only if MaaS cannot meet the requirement. Requires full justification.
> - **None** — this lab does not use AI at runtime.

**If they choose MaaS**, ask:
> **Which model tier fits your use case?**
> - **Open-source** (default, auto-approved) — Granite, Llama, Mistral, or similar. Use unless you have a specific reason not to.
> - **Frontier/premium model** — Claude Opus, GPT-4o, or similar. Why is open-source insufficient?

**If they choose frontier**, ask:
> **Why is an open-source model insufficient?** Be specific — what capability, context length, or quality requirement rules out open-source?

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.ai_requirement` (maas | gpu | none)
- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.ai_model_tier` (open-source | frontier)
- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.ai_model_name` — specific model if known
- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.ai_justification` — required if frontier or gpu

## Q16: AAP Version

**Ask when:** "Ansible Automation Platform" or "AAP" in products

> **Which version of AAP does this require?** (e.g., 2.4, 2.5)

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.aap_version`
- **Validation:** Required if AAP in products.

## Q17: External Services / Network Egress

> **Does this lab call any external services, APIs, or SaaS products outside the cluster?**
> List each by name. Examples: `github.com`, `registry.access.redhat.com`, a public API endpoint.
> Say "none" if there are no external dependencies.

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.external_services: []`
- **Validation:** Vague entries ("internet", "any public IP") → rejected. Must be named services.

## Q18: Non-GA Products

**Ask when:** Any product is labeled beta, tech preview, early access, or version is unclear

> **Does this lab use any non-GA products, tech previews, or beta features?**
> If yes: which products, and how will you provide access during lab provisioning?
> (Examples: product team special build, internal registry, license key, entitlement)

- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.non_ga_products: []`
- **spec.yaml field:** `spec.environment.non_ga_access_plan`
- **Validation:** If non_ga_products non-empty, access_plan must be non-empty.

## Approval Checklist Questions

*Note: Q19-Q21 were intentionally removed during the Part 5 spec revision (2026-07-14).
They covered manager-facing fields (demand signal, maintenance owner, shelf life) that the
content manager reads directly from the spec rather than collecting as authored fields.
Q22-Q24 numbers are preserved to maintain alignment with the gate validation spec (RHDPCD-170 Parts 3-5).*

*Ask Q22–Q24 before finalizing the spec. These go into approval_checklist in spec.yaml.*

## Q22: Prerequisites Verifiable In-Lab

> **What must the learner know or have done before starting Module 1?**
>
> And separately: can the lab automatically validate those prerequisites when the learner starts?
> For example: a check script that verifies a cluster is already connected, or a pre-flight that confirms credentials exist.

- **design.md section:** `## Prerequisites` (captures the list of prerequisites)
- **spec.yaml field:** `approval_checklist.content_lead.prerequisites_verifiable` (true | false — answers whether validation is possible)

## Q23: Assessment Strategy

> **How will we know the learner successfully completed each module?**
> For each module, describe how success is validated: a verification script, a visible result in the UI, a quiz question, or trust-based (learner self-reports).

- **spec.yaml field:** `approval_checklist.content_lead.assessment_strategy`
- **Validation:** Required. "Trust-based" is acceptable but must be explicit.

## Q24: Differentiation from Existing Content

**Before asking this question, the intake skill MUST poll the RCARS advisor job:**

1. Read `central` from `~/.config/publishing-house/auth.json` to get the Central API URL
2. If `job_id` was saved after Q3, poll for the result:
   ```bash
   curl -sk "{central_url}/api/v1/rcars/advisor/{job_id}" 2>&1
   ```
3. If `status` is `running` or `queued`, wait 5 seconds and poll again (up to 3 retries).
4. If `status` is `complete`, extract `result.candidates` (top 3).
5. If `job_id` is null (submit failed), skip the lookup and fall back to the blind question.

**If advisor returns candidates** (status=complete, candidates non-empty), present them:

> I checked the RHDP catalog for similar content. Here's what the advisor found:
>
> 1. **[display_name]** (relevance: [relevance_score]%)
>    *Why it's similar:* [why_it_fits — first sentence only]
>    *Caveat:* [caveats — first sentence only]
>
> 2. **[display_name]** (relevance: [relevance_score]%)
>    *Why it's similar:* [why_it_fits — first sentence only]
>
> 3. **[display_name]** (relevance: [relevance_score]%)
>    *Why it's similar:* [why_it_fits — first sentence only]
>
> **How does your lab specifically differ from these?** What does it cover that these labs don't? What's the unique value for a learner who has already seen one of these?

**If advisor returns no candidates** (empty list or all relevance_score < 50), present:

> I checked the RHDP catalog — no close matches found for your topic and audience. This looks like genuinely new territory.
>
> **Still, how would you describe what makes this lab unique?** (This helps reviewers understand the positioning.)

**If advisor failed or was unreachable** (job_id null, status=failed, or poll timed out), fall back:

> **In your own words: how does this differ from existing content on similar topics?**
> Reference specific existing labs you're aware of, and explain what this adds.

**spec.yaml fields:**

- `approval_checklist.content_lead.differentiation` — author's response (required, non-empty)
- `approval_checklist.content_lead.rcars_overlap_pct` — highest `relevance_score` from candidates (or null)
- `approval_checklist.content_lead.rcars_top_matches` — list from candidates, mapped as:
  ```yaml
  rcars_top_matches:
    - title: "[display_name]"
      ci_name: "[ci_name]"
      url: "https://catalog.demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=[ci_name]"
      relevance_score: [relevance_score]
      why_it_fits: "[why_it_fits]"
  ```
- **Validation:** `differentiation` must be non-empty before intake completes.

## Rules

- Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for the answer before asking the next.
- Use the **exact wording** above. Do not rephrase, merge, or reorder questions.
- If the user's answer to one question also answers a later question, mark that later question as answered and skip it.
- After each answer, immediately update `publishing-house/spec.yaml` with the captured value.
- If an answer is vague, ask a single follow-up to clarify before moving on.
- Q14–Q18 are infrastructure gates: if any required field is blank, intake is NOT complete. Do not signal completion to the orchestrator until all required fields are set.
- **RCARS advisor is mandatory** — always fire the advisor query after Q3 and poll before Q24. Only fall back to the blind question if the submit failed or the job didn't complete after retries.
